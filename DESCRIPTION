Description: The purpose of the mustangnews package is to assist The Hill, 
  the data journalism team at Mustang News (Cal Polyâ€™s newspaper), in data 
  collection and visualization. The data collection side contains functions 
  that scrape the websites of the San Luis Obispo PD and Cal Poly University 
  Police Departments and reformats the police activity/call logs into usable 
  data frames. In addition there are functions that scrape other Cal Poly
  websites, such as the Greek Life Chapter Sanction page, and can compare 
  them to old versions of the page so that the team can stay up to date. 
  Many of the members of The Hill do not have experience with R, so the 
  goal of the visualization functions is to simplify the process for them. 
  In addition to a custom theme in the style of the Mustang News website, 
  this package includes functions that simplify the creation of  bar graphs 
  and line charts. In hopes to support online stories as well as to print ones,
  this package also includes functions that can easily create interactive
  choropleths (colored maps) at both the state and county level.
